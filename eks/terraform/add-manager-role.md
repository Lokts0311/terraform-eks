In this Terraform configuration, you are setting up IAM roles and policies for Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), and you're configuring permissions for a user (`manager`) to assume a role (`eks_admin`) that allows them to manage EKS resources. Let's break down each section of this Terraform configuration and explain what each part is doing.

---

### **1. `data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}`**
```hcl
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}
```
- This data source fetches the **AWS account ID** of the current AWS identity (the entity running this Terraform code).
- It is used later in the configuration to reference the account ID dynamically, making the configuration more flexible and reusable across different accounts.

---

### **2. `resource "aws_iam_role" "eks_admin" {}`**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "eks_admin" {
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Principal": {
          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:root"
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
```
- **Role Name**: `eks_admin` IAM role.
- **Assume Role Policy**: This defines the **trust relationship** that specifies who can assume the role. In this case, it allows **all identities** (users, roles, groups, and services) within the **same AWS account** to assume this role.
- The `"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:root"` means that any entity from the same AWS account can assume the `eks_admin` role.

---

### **3. `resource "aws_iam_policy" "eks_admin" {}`**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy" "eks_admin" {
  name = "AmazonEKSAdminPolicy"

  policy = jsonencode({
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["eks:*"],
        "Resource": "*"
      },
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "iam:PassRole",
        "Resource": "*",
        "Condition": {
          "StringEquals": {
            "iam:PassedToService": "eks.amazonaws.com"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
```
- **Policy Name**: `AmazonEKSAdminPolicy`.
- **First Statement**: Grants the role full access (`eks:*`) to all EKS resources (`Resource: "*"`) in the account.
- **Second Statement**: Allows the role to pass IAM roles (`iam:PassRole`) to EKS (`iam:PassedToService` condition ensures this only applies to EKS). This allows the role to attach IAM roles to EKS services (like for EKS worker nodes).

---

### **4. `resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "eks_admin" {}`**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "eks_admin" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.eks_admin.name
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.eks_admin.arn
}
```
- This resource attaches the `AmazonEKSAdminPolicy` policy to the `eks_admin` IAM role.
- It binds the permissions in the policy to the role, so anyone assuming this role will inherit those permissions.

---

### **5. `resource "aws_iam_user" "manager" {}`**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_user" "manager" {
  name = "manager"
}
```
- **IAM User Name**: `manager`.
- This creates an IAM user named `manager`.

---

### **6. `resource "aws_iam_policy" "eks_assume_admin" {}`**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_policy" "eks_assume_admin" {
  name = "AmazonEKSAssumeAdminPolicy"

  policy = jsonencode({
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Resource": "${aws_iam_role.eks_admin.arn}"
      }
    ]
  })
}
```
- **Policy Name**: `AmazonEKSAssumeAdminPolicy`.
- **Action**: Allows the `manager` user to perform the `sts:AssumeRole` action, but only for the `eks_admin` role (`Resource: ${aws_iam_role.eks_admin.arn}`).
- This policy grants the `manager` user the permission to **assume the `eks_admin` role**, which they will need in order to perform EKS administration tasks.

---

### **7. `resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "manager" {}`**
```hcl
resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "manager" {
  role       = aws_iam_role.manager.name
  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.eks_assume_admin.arn
}
```
- This attaches the `AmazonEKSAssumeAdminPolicy` to the `manager` user.
- It grants the `manager` user permission to assume the `eks_admin` role.

---

### **How It All Works Together**

- **Step 1**: The `eks_admin` role is created with a trust policy allowing any entity within the same AWS account to assume it. The role also has full permissions to manage EKS and pass roles to EKS services.
- **Step 2**: The `manager` IAM user is created.
- **Step 3**: A policy (`AmazonEKSAssumeAdminPolicy`) is created and attached to the `manager` user, granting permission to call `sts:AssumeRole` for the `eks_admin` role.
- **Step 4**: When the `manager` user needs to manage EKS, they can **assume the `eks_admin` role**, inheriting all the permissions needed to manage EKS clusters.

---

### **Final Outcome**

- The `manager` user has the ability to **assume the `eks_admin` role**, which grants them full EKS administrative privileges.
- The `eks_admin` role has permissions to manage EKS resources and to **pass roles** to EKS services.
